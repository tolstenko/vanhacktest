I choose to do this challenge: https://app.vanhack.com/Challenges/Details?id=62

## Opening

In order to use this project you must install flutter. You can open this project using Android Studio or IntelliJ Idea.

## Motivation

I blanked for about 20min thinking in what I could do to prove my worth. I think my valuable characteristic might be how fast I can learn. So I challenged myself to learn and code the solution for the problem above using Flutter. Note that I never used flutter before. I am a primarily game developer and backend. So I am truly facing something new.

The problem is similar to counting working hours.

## Steps taken
1. Donwloaded and installed flutter;
2. Searched for libs to help: `charts_flutter` looks promising;
3. Created the project
4. Create data structures to store all 3 formats;
 * I tried to not oversimplify things, so I reproduced the data structure the same way it was given.
5. Started processing the data per month.
6. I choose to deal with weekly problem later;
7. Developed interface;
8. Attack the weekly problem;
